Today our society is more dependent on technology than ever before. The reality is, whether it is an individual, a small enterprise, or a large multinational company, we all rely on computer systems. With so many access points and incessant traffic, black hat hackers are creating malicious software with the aim of exploiting vulnerabilities. Furthermore, hackers are becoming creative with their malware and how they bypass virus scans and firewalls. This makes cybersecurity an ever-evolving field of research and problem-solving. It was both the need of the hour and my curiosity about the field that drove me towards my venture into cybersecurity.

Having an already inquisitive mindset towards cyberseccurity. I joined [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham](https://www.amrita.edu/) to pursue my Bachelors as I was intrigued by a student driven cybersecurity club called team [bi0s](https://bi0s.in/) which is ranked as the No. 1 CTF (Capture the Flag) team in India. I have participated in CTFs, wherein I learnt reversing binaries (ELFs/PEs) based on different architectures using debuggers and decompilers, malware analysis, game and apk reversing and fuzzing. I have helped organize the [InCTF](https://inctf.in/) (hosted by team bi0s) at the high school, national and international levels where I made reverse engineering-based challenges. I took on more responsibility and was made the team lead for [Shakti](https://teamshakti.in/) and bi0s. I took decisions that helped the team grow and mentored incoming juniors about the field. I went from being a mentee to a contributor in the club to finally a leader. Over the years I have not only improved as a reverse engineer but also as an organized team player, a better communicator, and a responsible team leader as a result of being able to practice my abilities through my peers and the club.
